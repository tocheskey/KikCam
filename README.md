## Installation 

Simply download the provided IPA under [releases](https://github.com/synecx/KikCam/releases) and sideload it to your device using [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com).

**Note**: There is a small bug where the app will throw an error upon logging in for the first time. To fix this, simply click on the "Next" button again at login.

## Want to build your own version?

If you would like to build your own modified version, you need to use [theos-jailed](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed). Be sure to change the ```KikCam_IPA``` location in the Makefile to the location of your decrypted IPA. You can find the decrypted Kik IPA I used in the [releases tab](https://github.com/synecx/KikCam/releases).
