# KikCam

Modified version of Kik that makes gallery images seem as if they were taken by the camera.

## Installation 

Simply download the provided IPA under [releases](https://github.com/synecx/KikCam/releases) and sideload it to your device using [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com).

## Want to make additional tweaks?

If you would like to build your own modified version, you need to use [theos-jailed](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed). You can also find the decrypted Kik IPA I used in the [releases tab](https://github.com/synecx/KikCam/releases).
